  "enhanced_description": "Green Curry (Gaeng Keow Wan) is Thai cuisine's emerald jewel - a coconut curry that perfectly balances creamy richness with herbaceous heat. Unlike its red and yellow cousins, green curry gets its color and flavor from fresh green chilies and herbs, making it bright, aromatic, and surprisingly complex. The name literally means 'sweet green curry' but don't be fooled - it packs serious heat.",
