  "enhanced_description": "Oh Aew is Phuket's most beloved traditional dessert, a refreshing shaved ice treat that perfectly captures the essence of Southern Thai sweets. This colorful dessert features delicate jelly cubes made from banana flour (or sometimes rice flour), creating a unique chewy texture that contrasts beautifully with the fine shaved ice. The jellies are traditionally dyed in vibrant colors - red, green, and yellow - making it as visually appealing as it is delicious. Topped with sweet syrup and creamy coconut milk, Oh Aew offers a perfect balance of textures and a gentle sweetness that's never overwhelming. It's the ultimate cooling dessert for Phuket's tropical climate, often enjoyed at local markets or beachside stalls where the rhythmic sound of ice being shaved adds to the authentic experience.",

  "cooking_method": {
    "technique": "Boiling and setting jelly, then assembling with shaved ice",
    "steps_overview": "Making Oh Aew requires patience for the jelly-making process. The banana flour is mixed with water and food coloring, then slowly cooked while stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Once thickened, it's poured into trays and left to set. The magic happens during assembly - the jellies are cut into small cubes and layered with freshly shaved ice.",
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Stir the flour mixture constantly to prevent lumps",
      "Use natural food coloring from pandan or butterfly pea flowers",
      "Let jelly cool completely before cutting for clean edges",
      "Shave ice just before serving for best texture",
      "Drizzle syrup evenly for consistent sweetness"

  "cultural_significance": {
    "origin_story": "Oh Aew originated in Phuket over a century ago, brought by Hokkien Chinese immigrants who adapted their traditional desserts to local ingredients. The name 'Oh Aew' comes from the Hokkien dialect, reflecting Phuket's unique Peranakan heritage.",
    "cultural_importance": "This dessert represents Phuket's multicultural identity, blending Chinese dessert-making techniques with Thai ingredients. It's a symbol of the island's Baba-Nyonya culture and remains a must-try for visitors wanting to taste authentic Phuket cuisine beyond the tourist areas.",
