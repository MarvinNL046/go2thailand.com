  "enhanced_description": "Larb is Laos and Northeastern Thailand's national dish - a meat salad that's actually more like deconstructed sausage. This zesty, herbaceous 'salad' combines toasted rice powder, fresh herbs, and lime juice with minced meat, creating an explosion of textures and flavors. It's eaten with sticky rice and raw vegetables, embodying the Isaan way of eating: communal, balanced, and boldly flavored.",
