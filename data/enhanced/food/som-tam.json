  "enhanced_description": "Som Tam (Green Papaya Salad) is Isaan's gift to the world - a explosive combination of flavors that attacks all your taste buds simultaneously. This pounded salad originated in Laos and northeastern Thailand, where the rhythmic 'pok pok' sound of the mortar and pestle is the soundtrack of every market. It's refreshing, spicy, funky, and addictive - the perfect balance of textures and tastes.",

      "Use a clay mortar, not wood - it grips ingredients better",
      "Pound and fold, don't mash - preserve the texture",
      "Taste constantly and adjust - every batch is unique",
      "The papaya should be bruised but still crunchy",
      "Make it spicier than you think - the sweetness balances it"

  "cultural_significance": {
    "origin_story": "Originated in Laos and spread throughout Isaan (northeastern Thailand). Rural communities created it as a way to use unripe papaya and preserve fish. The dish represents the resourcefulness of Isaan people.",
