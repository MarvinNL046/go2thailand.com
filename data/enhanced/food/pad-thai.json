  "enhanced_description": "Pad Thai is Thailand's most iconic dish, a perfect harmony of sweet, sour, and salty flavors wrapped around silky rice noodles. Born from a 1930s nationalism campaign, this stir-fried noodle dish has become the global ambassador of Thai cuisine. The secret lies in the tamarind-based sauce and the wok hei (breath of the wok) that only comes from expert high-heat cooking.",

  "cooking_method": {
    "technique": "Wok stir-frying with proper sequencing",
    "steps_overview": "Pad Thai is all about timing and technique. Each ingredient enters the wok at precisely the right moment. The noodles must be soft but not mushy, the egg ribboned through, and everything tossed with enough force to combine but gentle enough not to break the noodles.",
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Soak noodles in room temperature water, not hot - prevents mushiness",
      "Keep ingredients moving constantly in the wok",
      "Push ingredients up the sides of the wok to create cooking zones",
      "The sauce should caramelize slightly on the noodles",
      "Add bean sprouts at the very end for crunch"

  "cultural_significance": {
    "origin_story": "Created in the 1930s as part of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram's nation-building campaign. He wanted a national dish that would unify Thailand and reduce rice consumption during World War II. The name literally means 'Thai-style stir-fry'.",
    "cultural_importance": "Pad Thai represents Thai culinary diplomacy. It's often the first Thai dish foreigners try and has become synonymous with Thai cuisine globally. In Thailand, the quality of a cook is often judged by their Pad Thai.",
