Initially conceived as a recreational area for Bangkok's elite, it has since evolved into a public space for all citizens.

Today, it stands as a symbol of tranquility in the bustling city, reflecting the importance of green spaces in urban planning and the cultural value of relaxation and nature in Thai society.",
