## Thailand Island Hopping Guide: Everything You Need to Know

Thailand is home to over 1,400 islands scattered across the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. From the limestone karsts of Krabi to the full-moon parties of Koh Phangan, island hopping is one of the most rewarding ways to experience the country. This guide covers the best routes, transport options, and practical tips to help you plan an unforgettable island adventure.

## The Two Main Island Hopping Routes

Thailand's islands split neatly into two coasts, each with its own character, season, and ferry network. Choosing the right route depends on when you travel and what kind of experience you are after.

### The Gulf Islands Route (East Coast)

The Gulf of Thailand islands are known for their calm waters, coconut-lined beaches, and lively nightlife. This route is ideal from **December through August**, when seas are calm and skies are clear.

A popular Gulf route looks like this:

1. **Bangkok to [Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/)** -- Fly direct (1 hour) or take an overnight bus-and-ferry combo from Surat Thani
2. **Koh Samui to [Koh Phangan](/islands/koh-phangan/)** -- 30-minute speedboat or 1-hour ferry (150-350 THB)
3. **Koh Phangan to [Koh Tao](/islands/koh-tao/)** -- 1.5-hour ferry (350-600 THB)
4. **Koh Tao back to the mainland** -- Night boat to Chumphon, then train or bus to Bangkok

**Highlights of this route:**
- World-class diving at Koh Tao (courses from 9,000 THB)
- Full Moon Party on Koh Phangan
- Luxury resorts and family-friendly beaches on Koh Samui
- Ang Thong National Marine Park day trip

### The Andaman Route (West Coast)

The Andaman Sea islands are famous for dramatic scenery, crystal-clear water, and some of the best snorkelling in Southeast Asia. The best season here is **November through April**, when the monsoon retreats and ferry services run at full capacity.

A classic Andaman route:

1. **Bangkok to [Phuket](/islands/phuket/)** -- Fly direct (1.5 hours) or bus (12 hours)
2. **Phuket to [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/)** -- 2-hour ferry (350-450 THB)
3. **Koh Phi Phi to [Koh Lanta](/islands/koh-lanta/)** -- 1-hour ferry (300-400 THB)
4. **Koh Lanta to [Krabi](/cities/krabi/)** -- 2-hour ferry or minivan (250-350 THB)

**Highlights of this route:**
- Maya Bay on Koh Phi Phi (reservation required)
- Laid-back vibes on Koh Lanta
- Rock climbing in Railay from Krabi
- Similan Islands day trips from Phuket (November-May only)

> **Pro Tip:** If you have three weeks or more, you can connect the two coasts. Take a ferry from Koh Lanta to Trang, then cross overland to Surat Thani and catch a boat to Koh Samui. Several joint tickets cover the whole journey for around 800-1,200 THB.

## How to Get Between Islands

Getting from island to island in Thailand is straightforward once you understand the options:

- **Ferries** -- The most common option. Large, stable boats that cost 200-600 THB per leg. Book at the pier or online through 12Go Asia.
- **Speedboats** -- Faster but rougher. Typically double the price of a standard ferry. Good if you get seasick on slow boats (shorter exposure time).
- **Longtail boats** -- Used for short hops, like Railay Beach to Ao Nang. Usually 100-200 THB per person.
- **Joint tickets** -- Bus-and-ferry combos that take you door-to-door from your hotel. Convenient but slower due to waiting times at transfer points.

### Booking Tips

- Book ferries 1-2 days in advance during peak season (December-January). Outside of peak, you can usually buy at the pier.
- Check [12Go Asia](https://12go.asia) for schedules and online booking.
- In low season (May-October on the Andaman side), many ferry routes are reduced or suspended. Always confirm schedules locally.

## Best Time for Island Hopping

| Region | Best Season | Avoid |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Gulf Islands | Dec - Aug | Oct - Nov (storms) |
| Andaman Islands | Nov - Apr | May - Oct (monsoon) |

The **shoulder months** (November on the Gulf, April-May on the Andaman) can offer great deals with fewer crowds. Read our full [best time to visit Thailand](/blog/best-time-to-visit-thailand/) breakdown for month-by-month details.

## Budget Breakdown

Here is what a typical day of island hopping costs for a budget traveller:

| Expense | Budget (THB) | Mid-Range (THB) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Hostel / guesthouse | 300-500 | 800-1,500 |
| Food (3 meals) | 200-350 | 500-900 |
| Ferry (per leg) | 200-400 | 350-600 |
| Activities | 0-500 | 500-1,500 |
| **Daily total** | **700-1,750** | **2,150-4,500** |

For a two-week island hopping trip, budget travellers can expect to spend around **15,000-25,000 THB** (roughly 400-700 USD), not including flights to Thailand. Check our [Thailand budget backpacker guide](/blog/thailand-budget-backpacker-guide/) for more money-saving tips.

## Packing Essentials for Island Hopping

Travelling light is critical when you are hopping between islands. Ferries, longtails, and speedboats offer limited luggage space, and you will be carrying your bag along sandy beaches and up steep pier steps.

- **Dry bag** -- Protects your electronics on boat transfers. A 20L bag costs around 200-400 THB at any tourist shop.
- **Reef-safe sunscreen** -- Many marine parks now require reef-safe products.
- **Waterproof phone pouch** -- Essential for boat trips and beach days.
- **Light backpack (40L or less)** -- Skip the rolling suitcase. A smaller bag makes transfers painless.
- **Snorkel mask** -- Renting costs 100-200 THB per day; buying your own pays off quickly.

## Safety Tips

- **Check weather conditions** before booking boats. If seas are rough, delay your trip.
- **Wear a life jacket** on every boat, even if other passengers skip it.
- **Travel insurance** is non-negotiable. Make sure your policy covers water activities and medical evacuation from islands.
- **Watch for jellyfish** during rainy season, especially on Gulf islands between July and October.

## Sample 2-Week Island Hopping Itinerary

Here is a suggested route that covers the best of both coasts:

- **Days 1-2:** Arrive in [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok/), explore the city
- **Days 3-4:** Fly to Koh Samui, beach time and Ang Thong day trip
- **Days 5-6:** Ferry to [Koh Phangan](/islands/koh-phangan/), explore Bottle Beach
- **Days 7-8:** Ferry to [Koh Tao](/islands/koh-tao/), diving or snorkelling
- **Day 9:** Ferry to Chumphon, fly to Phuket
- **Days 10-11:** [Phuket](/islands/phuket/) beaches and Old Town
- **Days 12-13:** Ferry to [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/), Maya Bay
- **Day 14:** Ferry to Krabi, depart

This itinerary works best in **January through March**, when both coasts enjoy dry weather.

## Final Thoughts

Whether you are a backpacker sleeping in bamboo huts or a couple looking for overwater villas, there is a route and budget that works for you.
