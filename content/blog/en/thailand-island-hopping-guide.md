## 1. The Two Main Island Hopping Routes

Thailand's islands split neatly into two coasts, each with its own character, season, and **ferry** network. Choosing the right route depends on [when you travel](/weather/) and what kind of experience you are after.

### The Gulf Islands Route (East Coast)

The **Gulf of Thailand** islands are known for their calm waters, coconut-lined **beaches**, and lively nightlife. This route is ideal from **December through August**, when seas are calm and skies are clear.

A popular Gulf route looks like this:

1. **Bangkok to [Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/)** -- Fly direct (1 hour) or take an overnight bus-and-ferry combo from Surat Thani via a [joint transport ticket](/transport/)
2. **Koh Samui to [Koh Phangan](/islands/koh-phangan/)** -- 30-minute **speedboat** or 1-hour **ferry** (150-350 THB)
3. **Koh Phangan to [Koh Tao](/islands/koh-tao/)** -- 1.5-hour ferry (350-600 THB)
4. **Koh Tao back to the mainland** -- Night boat to Chumphon, then train or bus to Bangkok

**Highlights of this route:**
- World-class **diving** at Koh Tao (courses from 9,000 THB)
- Full Moon Party on Koh Phangan
- Luxury resorts and family-friendly **beaches** on [Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/)
- Ang Thong National Marine Park day trip

### The Andaman Route (West Coast)

The **Andaman Sea** islands are famous for dramatic scenery, crystal-clear water, and some of the best **snorkelling** in Southeast Asia. The best season here is **November through April**, when the **monsoon season** retreats and ferry services run at full capacity. Always check the [weather guide](/weather/) before booking.

A classic Andaman route:

1. **Bangkok to [Phuket](/islands/phuket/)** -- Fly direct (1.5 hours) or bus (12 hours) -- see [transport options](/transport/)
2. **Phuket to [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/)** -- 2-hour **ferry** (350-450 THB)
3. **Koh Phi Phi to [Koh Lanta](/islands/koh-lanta/)** -- 1-hour ferry (300-400 THB)
4. **Koh Lanta to [Krabi](/cities/krabi/)** -- 2-hour ferry or minivan (250-350 THB)

**Highlights of this route:**
- Maya Bay on [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/) (reservation required)
- Laid-back vibes and **beach** bars on [Koh Lanta](/islands/koh-lanta/)
- Rock climbing in Railay from Krabi
- Similan Islands **snorkelling** day trips from [Phuket](/islands/phuket/) (November-May only)

> **Pro Tip:** If you have three weeks or more, you can connect the two coasts. Take a **ferry** from Koh Lanta to Trang, then cross overland to Surat Thani and catch a boat to [Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/). Several [joint tickets](/transport/) cover the whole journey for around 800-1,200 THB.

## 2. How to Get Between Islands

Getting from island to island in Thailand is straightforward once you understand the [transport options](/transport/):

- **Ferries** -- The most common option. Large, stable boats that cost 200-600 THB per leg. Book at the pier or online through 12Go Asia.
- **Speedboats** -- Faster but rougher. Typically double the price of a standard **ferry**. Good if you get seasick on slow boats (shorter exposure time).
- **Longtail boats** -- Used for short hops, like Railay **Beach** to Ao Nang. Usually 100-200 THB per person.
- **Joint tickets** -- Bus-and-ferry combos that take you door-to-door from your hotel. Convenient but slower due to waiting times at transfer points.

### Booking Tips

- Book **ferries** 1-2 days in advance during peak season (December-January). Outside of peak, you can usually buy at the pier.
- Check [12Go Asia](https://12go.asia) for schedules and online booking.
- In low season (May-October on the **Andaman** side), many ferry routes are reduced or suspended. Always confirm schedules locally and review the [weather forecast](/weather/).
- Stay connected while travelling between islands -- grab a **Thai eSIM** from our [eSIM guide](/esim/) so you can check schedules, maps, and booking apps on the go.

## 3. Best Time for Island Hopping

| Region | Best Season | Avoid |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Gulf Islands | Dec - Aug | Oct - Nov (storms) |
| Andaman Islands | Nov - Apr | May - Oct (**monsoon season**) |

The **shoulder months** (November on the Gulf, April-May on the Andaman) can offer great deals with fewer crowds. Read our full [best time to visit Thailand](/blog/best-time-to-visit-thailand/) breakdown for month-by-month details, or check the dedicated [weather page](/weather/) for seasonal charts and rainfall data.

## 4. Budget Breakdown

Here is what a typical day of **island hopping** costs for a budget traveller:

| Expense | Budget (THB) | Mid-Range (THB) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Hostel / guesthouse | 300-500 | 800-1,500 |
| Food (3 meals) | 200-350 | 500-900 |
| Ferry (per leg) | 200-400 | 350-600 |
| Activities | 0-500 | 500-1,500 |
| **Daily total** | **700-1,750** | **2,150-4,500** |

For a two-week **island hopping** trip, budget travellers can expect to spend around **15,000-25,000 THB** (roughly 400-700 USD), not including flights to Thailand. Check our [Thailand budget backpacker guide](/blog/thailand-budget-backpacker-guide/) for more money-saving tips. Island [food](/food/) is slightly pricier than the mainland, but street stalls near ferry piers still offer meals for 60-80 THB.

## 5. Packing Essentials for Island Hopping

Travelling light is critical when you are hopping between islands. **Ferries**, longtails, and **speedboats** offer limited luggage space, and you will be carrying your bag along sandy **beaches** and up steep pier steps. Check our [practical info page](/practical-info/) for a full Thailand packing checklist.

- **Dry bag** -- Protects your electronics on boat transfers. A 20L bag costs around 200-400 THB at any tourist shop.
- **Reef-safe sunscreen** -- Many marine parks now require reef-safe products.
- **Waterproof phone pouch** -- Essential for boat trips and **beach** days.
- **Light backpack (40L or less)** -- Skip the rolling suitcase. A smaller bag makes **backpacking** transfers painless.
- **Snorkel mask** -- Renting costs 100-200 THB per day; buying your own pays off quickly if you plan to do a lot of **snorkelling**.

## 6. Safety Tips

- **Check [weather conditions](/weather/)** before booking boats. If seas are rough, delay your trip -- especially during **monsoon season**.
- **Wear a life jacket** on every boat, even if other passengers skip it.
- **[Travel insurance](/travel-insurance/)** is non-negotiable. Make sure your policy covers **diving**, **snorkelling**, water activities, and medical evacuation from islands. Read our [travel insurance guide](/travel-insurance/) to compare plans.
- **Watch for jellyfish** during rainy season, especially on Gulf islands between July and October.
- Keep your [visa](/visa/) validity in mind if you plan a longer **island hopping** route -- check the [Thailand visa guide 2026](/blog/thailand-visa-guide-2026/) for extension options.
- For emergencies and [practical travel information](/practical-info/), save local emergency numbers and your embassy contact before heading to remote islands.

## 7. Sample 2-Week Island Hopping Itinerary

Here is a suggested route that covers the best of both coasts:

- **Days 1-2:** Arrive in [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok/), explore the city and try the [street food](/food/)
- **Days 3-4:** Fly to [Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/), **beach** time and Ang Thong day trip
- **Days 5-6:** **Ferry** to [Koh Phangan](/islands/koh-phangan/), explore Bottle Beach
- **Days 7-8:** Ferry to [Koh Tao](/islands/koh-tao/), **diving** or **snorkelling**
- **Day 9:** Ferry to Chumphon, fly to [Phuket](/islands/phuket/)
- **Days 10-11:** [Phuket](/islands/phuket/) **beaches** and Old Town
- **Days 12-13:** Ferry to [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/), Maya Bay
- **Day 14:** Ferry to [Krabi](/cities/krabi/), depart

This itinerary works best in **January through March**, when both coasts enjoy dry weather. Use the [weather guide](/weather/) to fine-tune your dates, and pick up a [Thai eSIM](/esim/) so you can rebook **ferries** and check conditions on the fly.

## 8. Final Thoughts

Thailand **island hopping** is one of Southeast Asia's greatest travel experiences.

Start by picking your coast, check the [season](/weather/), and book your first **ferry**. The rest will fall into place.

Browse all our [island guides](/islands/) to start planning your route, or read our [Thailand visa guide](/blog/thailand-visa-guide-2026/) to make sure your paperwork is sorted before you go.
