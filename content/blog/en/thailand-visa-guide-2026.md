## Thailand Visa Guide 2026: Everything You Need to Know

Planning a trip to Thailand and confused by **Thailand visa** rules? You are not alone. Thailand has updated its **immigration** policies several times in recent years, and 2026 brings a set of rules that are actually quite generous for most travellers. This guide breaks down every **visa** option, recent changes, and practical tips for extending your stay.

| Question | Key Answer |

| What happens if I overstay? | **Overstay** penalties start at 500 THB/day and can lead to multi-year bans from Thailand |
| Where do I find all visa types? | Our complete [visa overview](/visa/) covers every option with requirements and costs |

## 1. Visa-Free Entry (60 Days)

As of mid-2024, Thailand extended its **visa-free** stay from 30 to **60 days** for citizens of most Western countries. This applies to passport holders from:

- All EU countries (including the Netherlands, Germany, France)
- United Kingdom
- United States, Canada, Australia
- And 90+ other nationalities

**What you need:**
- Passport valid for at least 6 months
- Proof of onward travel (return flight or ticket to another country)
- Sufficient funds (20,000 THB per person or 40,000 THB per family -- rarely checked but technically required)

You will receive a **60-day stamp** on arrival at any international airport or land border crossing. For full eligibility details and country lists, see our dedicated [visa-free entry page](/visa/visa-free-entry/).

> **Pro Tip:** If 60 days is not enough, you can extend your **visa-free** stay by 30 days at any **immigration** office in Thailand for 1,900 THB. That gives you up to 90 days total without needing a visa in advance. Read our [visa extension guide](/visa/visa-extension/) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

## 2. Tourist Visa (TR) -- Up to 90 Days

If you know you want to stay longer than 60 days, apply for a [Tourist Visa (TR)](/visa/tourist-visa/) before departure at a Thai embassy or consulate. This grants **60 days on arrival**, extendable by another **30 days** at immigration.

**Requirements:**
- Completed application form
- Passport-sized photo
- Flight itinerary
- Proof of accommodation
- Bank statement showing equivalent of 20,000 THB
- Fee: varies by country (typically 35-40 EUR)

For most travellers from visa-free countries, the [visa-free 60-day entry](/visa/visa-free-entry/) is sufficient. The **tourist visa** mainly benefits those who want the certainty of a pre-approved longer stay.

## 3. Destination Thailand Visa (DTV) -- 180 Days

The **Destination Thailand Visa** launched in 2024 and has been a game-changer for **digital nomads**, remote workers, and long-stay travellers. It allows a stay of **180 days**, extendable once for another 180 days.

**Who qualifies:**
- Remote workers and **digital nomads**
- People attending courses, workshops, or retreats in Thailand
- Those participating in sports training (Muay Thai, yoga)
- Attendees of music festivals or cultural events
- Medical or wellness tourists

**Requirements:**
- Proof of remote work, enrollment in a course, or event tickets
- 500,000 THB in savings (or equivalent in foreign currency)
- Fee: 10,000 THB (approximately 260 EUR)

The **DTV visa** is a **multiple-entry visa**, meaning you can leave and re-enter Thailand during the 180-day period. This makes it ideal for people who want to use Thailand as a base for exploring Southeast Asia -- hop over to neighbouring countries and return without losing your visa status.

Visit our [DTV visa page](/visa/digital-nomad-visa/) for a full application walkthrough. Popular bases for **digital nomads** include [Bangkok](/city/bangkok/) for its urban energy and coworking spaces, and [Chiang Mai](/city/chiang-mai/) for its affordable cost of living and thriving expat community.

## 4. Other Visa Types

### Non-Immigrant Visa B (Business)
For those working in Thailand with a job offer. Requires a work permit. Usually arranged by your employer.

### Non-Immigrant Visa O (Family/Retirement)
- **Retirement visa:** For those aged 50+ with 800,000 THB in a Thai bank account or monthly income of 65,000 THB. See our full [retirement visa guide](/visa/retirement-visa/) for details.
- **Marriage visa:** For those married to a Thai national with 400,000 THB in a Thai bank account

### Education Visa (Non-Immigrant ED)
For students enrolled in Thai language courses, university programs, or Muay Thai training at certified schools. Valid for 90 days, extendable. Read more on our [education visa page](/visa/education-visa/).

### Thailand Elite Visa
A premium long-stay option costing from 600,000 THB (5-year membership) to 2,000,000 THB (20 years). Includes airport VIP services, fast-track **immigration**, and other perks. Best for frequent visitors and long-term residents who want zero hassle. Learn more on our [Thailand Elite Visa page](/visa/thailand-elite-visa/).

### Long-Term Resident (LTR) Visa
A newer option for wealthy individuals, retirees with pensions, remote workers earning high incomes, and highly skilled professionals. Offers up to 10 years of residency. Check our [LTR visa page](/visa/ltr-visa/) for eligibility requirements.

Read our complete [visa types overview](/visa/) for details on each option.

## 5. How to Extend Your Stay

**Visa extensions** are handled at **immigration offices** around Thailand. The main offices are in:

- [Bangkok](/city/bangkok/) (Chaeng Wattana)
- [Chiang Mai](/city/chiang-mai/) (Promenada Mall)
- [Phuket](/city/phuket/) (Phuket Town)
- Koh Samui (near Nathon)

### Extension Process

1. Go to the **immigration** office early (before 10:00 AM to avoid long queues)
2. Bring your passport, a passport photo (4x6 cm), a copy of your passport and entry stamp, and 1,900 THB in cash
3. Fill out the TM.7 form (available at the office)
4. Wait for processing (usually 1-3 hours)

Most **visa extensions** are granted on the spot. The 30-day extension applies to both [visa-free entries](/visa/visa-free-entry/) and [Tourist Visas](/visa/tourist-visa/). For full details, visit our [visa extension guide](/visa/visa-extension/).

> **Pro Tip:** **Immigration** offices in smaller cities like [Chiang Mai](/city/chiang-mai/) or Hua Hin are much less crowded than Bangkok. If you can plan your extension around a visit to one of these cities, you will save hours of waiting. Combine it with some sightseeing -- check our [practical info section](/practical-info/) for tips on getting around.

## 6. Border Runs: What You Need to Know

A "border run" means leaving Thailand and re-entering to get a fresh **entry stamp**. While this was common in the past, **immigration** officials now scrutinize repeated entries more closely.

**Current rules:**
- You are allowed **2 visa-free land border entries per calendar year**
- Air entries have no official limit, but a pattern of repeated short stays may raise questions
- Officers can refuse entry if they suspect you are living in Thailand without the proper **visa**

If you plan to stay long-term, the [DTV visa](/visa/digital-nomad-visa/) or a proper Non-Immigrant visa is a far better option than relying on border runs. For information on getting to and from border crossings, see our [transport guide](/transport/).

## 7. Overstay Penalties

Do not **overstay** your visa. Thailand enforces **overstay penalties** strictly:

| Duration | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| 1 day | 500 THB per day (max 20,000 THB) |
| Over 90 days | 1-year ban from Thailand |
| Over 1 year | 3-year ban |
| Over 3 years | 5-year ban |
| Over 5 years | 10-year ban |

If caught at an internal checkpoint (not at departure), the penalties are even more severe. Set a reminder on your phone 2 weeks before your stamp expires. If you are unsure about your permitted stay, visit the nearest **immigration** office or check your [visa extension options](/visa/visa-extension/).

## 8. Arrival Tips

### At the Airport
- Fill out the **TM.6 departure card** on the plane (some airports have eliminated this, but it is still in use at most)
- Have your hotel address ready for the arrival card
- **Immigration** queues at Suvarnabhumi ([Bangkok](/city/bangkok/)) can take 30-60 minutes during peak hours; Don Mueang is usually faster
- Automated passport gates are available for some nationalities
- Consider getting a [Thailand eSIM](/esim/) before you land so you have data connectivity right away

### At Land Borders
- Popular crossings: Poipet (Cambodia), Nong Khai (Laos), Padang Besar (Malaysia)
- Carry passport photos and cash for any required fees
- Be wary of scams at busy border crossings -- only pay fees at official windows. Read our [scams & safety guide](/practical-info/scams-safety/) so you know what to watch out for

### After Clearing Immigration
Once you are through **immigration**, make sure to sort out [transport from the airport](/transport/) to your accommodation, pick up a local [eSIM](/esim/) if you have not already, and consider arranging [travel insurance](/travel-insurance/) if you have not done so before departure. Our [practical info hub](/practical-info/) covers everything from [ATMs and money](/practical-info/atm-money/) to [health and vaccinations](/practical-info/health-vaccinations/).

## 10. Final Thoughts

Thailand's **visa** system is more welcoming than ever in 2026. For most visitors, the **60-day visa-free entry** (plus a **30-day extension**) is more than enough time to explore the country -- from the temples of [Bangkok](/city/bangkok/) to the beaches of [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/) and the mountains of [Chiang Mai](/city/chiang-mai/). **Digital nomads** and long-stay travellers should look seriously at the **DTV visa**, which offers flexibility that was simply not available a few years ago.
