## 1. Thailand's Three Seasons

Thailand does not have the four seasons you might be used to. Instead, the year divides into three distinct seasons, each offering a different travel experience. Understanding these seasons is essential for planning the **best time to visit Thailand** for your priorities. For detailed temperature and rainfall data by month, visit our [weather page](/weather/).

### Hot Season (March - May)
- Temperatures regularly hit **35-40+C**, with April being the hottest month
- Humidity is high and the heat can be exhausting, especially in [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok/)
- Lower tourist numbers and better hotel deals
- **Songkran** (Thai New Year water festival) in April is a major highlight -- the biggest festival in the country
- Great time for **Gulf coast** beaches like [Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/) and [Koh Phangan](/islands/koh-phangan/)
- Stay connected on the go with a [Thailand eSIM](/esim/) -- no need to hunt for SIM card shops in the heat

### Rainy Season (June - October)
- The southwest **monsoon** brings daily rain showers, usually in the afternoon
- Rain is heavy but short -- expect 1-2 hours of downpour followed by sunshine
- Lush green landscapes and waterfalls at their best
- Lowest prices for accommodation and flights -- ideal for **budget travellers**
- Some **Andaman Sea** islands ([Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/), [Koh Lipe](/islands/koh-lipe/)) have reduced ferry services -- check [transport options](/transport/) before booking
- Consider [travel insurance](/travel-insurance/) for **rainy season** trips, especially if booking ferries and flights

### Cool Season (November - February)
- The most comfortable weather: **25-32C** with lower humidity
- Clear skies and calm seas on both coasts
- **Peak season** -- highest prices and biggest crowds
- Ideal for beach holidays, **island hopping**, and outdoor activities
- The **best island hopping season** runs through this entire period -- see our [island hopping guide](/blog/thailand-island-hopping-guide/) for routes and tips
- Perfect weather for exploring [Chiang Mai](/cities/chiang-mai/) and northern Thailand on foot

## 3. Regional Differences

Thailand's [weather](/weather/) is not uniform. Here is how the regions compare:

| Region | Best Months | Avoid |
|--------|------------|-------|
| [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok/) & Central | Nov - Feb | Apr (extreme heat) |
| Northern ([Chiang Mai](/cities/chiang-mai/), Chiang Rai) | Nov - Feb | Mar - Apr (burning season haze) |
| Gulf Coast ([Koh Samui](/islands/koh-samui/), [Koh Phangan](/islands/koh-phangan/), [Koh Tao](/islands/koh-tao/)) | Jan - Aug | Oct - Nov (storms) |
| Andaman Coast ([Phuket](/cities/phuket/), [Koh Phi Phi](/islands/koh-phi-phi/), [Krabi](/cities/krabi/), [Koh Lanta](/islands/koh-lanta/)) | Nov - Apr | May - Oct (**monsoon**) |

The key takeaway: **the Gulf and Andaman coasts have opposite seasons**. When one side is rainy, the other is often fine. This means there is almost always a good beach destination in Thailand regardless of when you visit. Browse all our [island guides](/islands/) to find the right match for your dates.

### A Note on Northern Thailand's Burning Season

From late February through April, farmers in northern Thailand and neighbouring countries burn agricultural fields. This creates a thick haze that blankets [Chiang Mai](/cities/chiang-mai/) and surrounding areas. Air quality can reach unhealthy levels. If you are sensitive to air quality or have respiratory issues, avoid northern Thailand during this period. Check our [weather page](/weather/) for air quality updates and our [practical travel tips](/practical-info/) for advice on dealing with haze season.

## 4. Festival Calendar Quick Reference

| Festival | When | Where |
|----------|------|-------|
| Chinese New Year | Jan/Feb | [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok/), [Phuket](/cities/phuket/) |
| **Songkran** | 13-15 April | Nationwide (best in [Chiang Mai](/cities/chiang-mai/) and [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok/)) |
| Visakha Bucha | May (full moon) | Nationwide |
| Vegetarian Festival | Sep/Oct | [Phuket](/cities/phuket/) |
| **Loy Krathong** | November (full moon) | Nationwide |

## 5. Which Time Is Best for You?

| Traveller Type | Best Time |

| [Street food](/food/) fanatic | November - February (comfortable weather for night markets) |

## 6. Final Thoughts

There is no truly bad time to visit Thailand. **Peak season** (November-February) offers the most predictable weather, but **low season** brings lower prices, fewer crowds, and a more authentic experience. The rain during **monsoon** months is rarely an all-day affair, and a thunderstorm can be one of the most dramatic things to watch from a beachside bar.
