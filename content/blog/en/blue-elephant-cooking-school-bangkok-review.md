## Blue Elephant Cooking School Bangkok: What to Expect

If you have ever searched for a **Thai cooking class in Bangkok**, you have probably come across the **Blue Elephant Royal Thai Cooking School**. It is one of the most well-known cooking schools in the country, housed in a stunning **100-year-old heritage building** in the heart of Bangkok. But at around EUR 121 per person, it is also one of the most expensive. We took the class to find out whether it lives up to the reputation -- and whether it is the right choice if you are new to Thai cooking.

## 1. Arriving at Blue Elephant

The first thing that strikes you is the building itself. Blue Elephant occupies a **heritage building over 100 years old**, and it feels more like stepping into an upscale restaurant than a cooking school -- because it is both. They run a popular **Thai restaurant** here alongside the cooking school.

We arrived a bit early and were led upstairs to a beautiful sitting area where we were served **tea and puffed rice cakes** while waiting for the rest of the group. It was a relaxed, welcoming start. Shortly after, we met **Chef Nor**, the owner of Blue Elephant. She has been in the Thai culinary world for over **40 years** and had just received an award the day before. She is warm, funny, and clearly passionate about Thai cuisine.

## 2. The Market Tour: Samyan Market

Before cooking, the group was taken to a **local fresh market** to learn about the ingredients used in Thai cooking. The school usually visits a nearby market, but on our day we were taken to **Samyan Market** -- a premium fresh market popular with Thai home cooks who want the best ingredients.

Our guide **Krishna** walked us through the market, explaining every ingredient in detail:

- **Galangal, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves** -- the aromatic foundation of Thai curries
- **Different types of Thai basil** and how each one is used
- **Coriander root** -- a key ingredient often overlooked in Western cooking (if you cannot find it at home, use the stems instead)
- **Chilies** -- the varieties used in green curry paste versus finishing garnishes

The market itself was impressive. Everything was **pristine** -- fresh fish with clear eyes on ice, spotless meat counters, and beautifully arranged produce. Prices are a bit higher than a typical local market, but the quality is outstanding. Krishna could tell which vegetables came from organic farms (darker, deeper green) versus conventional farming (lighter green).

> **Good to know:** The market visit is not about buying ingredients for the class. Blue Elephant works with dedicated suppliers who deliver fresh produce to the school daily. The market tour is educational -- a chance to learn about Thai ingredients, ask questions, and understand what goes into the food you are about to cook.

## 3. The Chef Demonstration

Back at Blue Elephant, the class moved to a **demonstration room** where **Chef Chai** showed us exactly how to make a Thai green curry from scratch. This was not a vague overview -- he went through every detail:

- All the **aromatics and spices** that go into the green curry paste
- How to use a **pestle and mortar** to grind the ingredients into a coarse paste (the traditional Thai way)
- The correct order for adding ingredients: when to add the **coconut milk**, when to add the vegetables, when to drop in the beef
- How long to cook each element -- the beef, for example, gets just **a few seconds** in the hot curry

After the demonstration, everyone got to taste a small bowl so we knew exactly what we were aiming for when it was our turn to cook.

## 4. Cooking: Four Dishes, Hands-On

This is the main event. Each person got their own **cooking station** with all ingredients prepared and ready. We received a **recipe booklet** and a **Blue Elephant apron** before getting started.

### Dish 1: Thai Green Curry

The most involved dish of the day. We started by chopping chilies, kaffir lime, galangal, shallots, garlic, and coriander root, then pounded everything into a paste using a pestle and mortar. This is **hard physical work** -- getting a smooth paste takes real effort.

For the curry itself, we cooked the paste in rice bran oil, added coconut cream gradually, then chicken stock with herbs. The vegetables went in next: **globe eggplant** (aubergine) and **pea eggplant**, followed by fish sauce and palm sugar for seasoning. The beef -- **Australian tenderloin** -- was added last and cooked for just seconds to keep it tender. A finishing touch of Thai basil and kaffir lime leaves, and done.

The result was genuinely impressive. Rich, aromatic, perfectly balanced. Even for someone who cooks Thai food regularly, there were useful techniques to pick up here -- particularly around paste preparation and the order of adding coconut milk.

### Dish 2: Golden Bags

We mixed **prawns and pork with green curry paste**, then wrapped the mixture in **wonton wrappers** tied with blanched spring onions. The wrapping technique was the challenge here -- it takes practice to get those neat little parcels. The school fried them for us afterward (this is a beginner's course, so some of the frying and grilling is handled by the kitchen).

### Dish 3: Chicken Cashew Nut

A classic Thai stir-fry. Straightforward to make and a reliable dish to replicate at home.

### Dish 4: Pad Thai

The final dish. Pad thai is one of those dishes that looks simple but has a specific technique to get right -- the noodle handling, the sauce balance, the timing of the egg. The recipe booklet has all the details, so you can recreate it at home.

## 5. Eating Your Food in the Restaurant

After cooking, the group moved downstairs to the **Blue Elephant restaurant** to eat everything we had made. All four dishes were plated and served properly -- it felt like a genuine restaurant meal, except you cooked it yourself.

This was also a nice social moment. By this point everyone in the class had become friends, helping each other out during the cooking and comparing results. It is a fun, shared experience.

At the end of the class, everyone received a **certificate of completion** -- a nice memento, even if it is obviously given to every participant.

## 6. Who Is This Class For?

Let us be clear: **this is a beginner's course**. If you are an experienced cook looking for advanced Thai techniques, this is not the right fit. But for its target audience, it works very well:

- **First-time visitors to Thailand** who want to understand Thai cooking from the ground up
- **Food lovers** who want a structured, premium experience rather than a budget class
- **Couples or small groups** looking for a memorable Bangkok activity
- **People who want to cook Thai food at home** -- the recipe booklet and techniques are genuinely useful

If you are looking for a more **budget-friendly option**, there are excellent Bangkok cooking classes starting from EUR 22. Check our [complete Bangkok cooking classes overview](/city/bangkok/cooking-classes/) to compare all options.

Blue Elephant also sells their handmade **curry pastes** online if you want to recreate the flavours at home without making the paste from scratch.

## 8. Our Verdict

The Blue Elephant cooking class is a **premium experience** and it feels like one. The heritage building, the knowledgeable staff, the market tour, the quality of ingredients, and the sit-down lunch all justify the higher price compared to budget classes. For someone visiting [Bangkok](/city/bangkok/) for the first time and wanting a polished introduction to Thai cooking, it is hard to beat.

That said, the price is **three to four times higher** than many excellent cooking classes in Bangkok. If budget is a concern, you can get a fantastic cooking experience for EUR 22-37 -- see all options in our [Bangkok cooking classes guide](/city/bangkok/cooking-classes/).
