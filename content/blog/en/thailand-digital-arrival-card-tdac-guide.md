# Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC): Complete Step-by-Step Guide 2026

Starting May 1, 2025, all non-Thai nationals entering Thailand by air, land, or sea must complete the **Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)** online before arrival.

## 1. What Is the Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)?

The **Thailand Digital Arrival Card** is a mandatory online immigration form that all foreign nationals must complete before entering Thailand. It replaces the traditional paper TM.6 arrival card that travelers previously filled out on planes or at immigration counters. The TDAC system is designed to streamline border processing, reduce paperwork, and enhance security by collecting passenger information digitally in advance.

When we first heard about this change during our time living in [Bangkok](https://go2-thailand.com/city/bangkok/), many long-term residents were skeptical. However, the system has proven efficient—immigration officers can now process arrivals faster, and the digital record helps authorities maintain better track of who's entering the country. The system applies to all entry points: airports, land borders, and seaports throughout Thailand.

### Who Must Complete the TDAC?

All non-Thai nationals entering Thailand by any means of transport must complete the TDAC. This includes:

- **Tourists** on visa-free entry or tourist visas
- **Digital nomads** and long-term visitors
- **Business travelers** on business visas
- **Expats** on work permits or retirement visas
- **Children** traveling with parents (parents complete on behalf of minors)

Thai nationals and ASEAN citizens with special agreements may have different requirements—check the official [Thailand Immigration Bureau](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/#/home) website for your specific nationality.

### What Information Is Required?

The TDAC collects standard immigration data to verify your eligibility to enter Thailand. You'll need to provide:

- **Personal details**: Full name, date of birth, nationality, passport number
- **Travel information**: [Flight](https://trip.tpo.lv/TmObooZ5)/transport details, arrival date, port of entry
- **Accommodation**: Address where you'll be staying in Thailand
- **Health declaration**: Any relevant health information (especially post-COVID protocols)
- **Purpose of visit**: Tourism, business, education, etc.

---

## 2. When Do You Need to Submit the TDAC?

Timing is critical with the TDAC system. According to the Immigration Act B.E. 2522 and official TAT guidelines, you must submit your digital arrival card **within 3 days before your arrival date** in Thailand. This means if you're arriving on Friday, you can submit your TDAC from Tuesday onwards.

In our [experience](https://getyourguide.tpo.lv/GuAFfGGK) helping travelers navigate this requirement, the most common mistake is waiting until the day before arrival. While technically within the window, last-minute submissions can sometimes encounter technical issues or verification delays. We recommend submitting your TDAC **5-7 days before arrival** to give the system time to process and to avoid any stress.

### Submission Timeline Best Practices

**Optimal timing**: 5-7 days before arrival — this gives you a comfortable buffer and allows time for any corrections if needed.

**Acceptable timing**: 3 days before arrival — the minimum required window; still acceptable but riskier.

**Not recommended**: Day of arrival or after — you may be denied entry or face significant delays at immigration.

**Pro Tip**: If you're unsure about your exact arrival date (flexible ticket), you can submit the TDAC with your best estimate and update it if needed, though changes may require resubmission.

> **Did You Know?** According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, the TDAC system processes over 50,000 arrivals daily during peak season, with an average processing time of less than 2 minutes per submission.

## 3. How to Complete Your TDAC: Step-by-Step Instructions

Completing your TDAC is straightforward and takes approximately 5-10 minutes. Here's the exact process we recommend:

### Step 1: Visit the Official TDAC Website


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#EFF6FF;border-left:4px solid #3B82F6;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:16px;">
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;margin-bottom:8px;">
        <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">🏨</span>
        <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#1F2937;">Book Your Stay</strong>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#4B5563;margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Compare hotels, resorts, and guesthouses across Thailand with free cancellation on most bookings.</p>
      <a href="https://booking.tpo.lv/2PT1kR82" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" style="display:inline-block;background:#2563EB;color:white;padding:10px 20px;border-radius:8px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:600;font-size:14px;">Search Hotels on Booking.com →</a>
    </div>
    <a href="https://booking.tpo.lv/2PT1kR82" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" style="flex-shrink:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;">
      <img src="/images/qrcodes/qrcode-booking.com.jpeg" alt="Scan to visit Book Your Stay" style="width:72px;height:72px;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #3B82F633;" />
      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


Navigate to the official Thailand Digital Arrival Card portal at **https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/#/home**. This is the only legitimate government portal—avoid third-party websites that claim to help with TDAC applications, as they may charge fees or collect unnecessary information.

### Step 2: Select Your Language and Nationality

The website offers multiple language options including English, Thai, Chinese, and others. Choose your preferred language, then select your nationality from the dropdown menu. This determines which specific requirements and information fields you'll need to complete.

### Step 3: Enter Your Personal Information

Fill in the following details exactly as they appear in your passport:

- **Full name** (first name and surname)
- **Date of birth** (DD/MM/YYYY format)
- **Passport number**
- **Passport expiration date**
- **Nationality**
- **Gender**
- **Email address** (you'll receive a confirmation here)
- **Phone number** (mobile number recommended)

**Important**: Your name must match your passport exactly. If you have a middle name on your passport, include it. Discrepancies can cause problems at immigration.

### Step 4: Provide Travel Details

Enter information about your upcoming trip:

- **Arrival date** (the date you'll enter Thailand)
- **Port of entry** (airport code, border crossing, or seaport name)
- **Flight/transport number** (if applicable)
- **Airline or transport operator name**

If you're arriving by land or sea, you may need to specify the border crossing or port name instead of a flight number.

### Step 5: Enter Your Thailand Accommodation Address

This is where you'll be staying during your initial days in Thailand. You can enter:

- **Hotel name and address** (if you have a booking)
- **Hostel details**
- **Airbnb address**
- **Friend's or family member's address**
- **Resort location**

You don't need a confirmed booking—an address is sufficient. If you're unsure where you'll stay, you can use your first hotel's address or a general area address (e.g., "Sukhumvit Road, Bangkok").

### Step 6: Declare Your Purpose of Visit

Select from the dropdown menu:

- Tourism
- Business
- Education
- Work
- Visiting family/friends
- Other (specify)

This helps immigration officers understand the nature of your visit.

### Step 7: Health and Security Declaration

Answer health-related questions honestly. These typically include:

- Do you have any contagious diseases?
- Have you been vaccinated (if applicable)?
- Any relevant health conditions immigration should know about?

These questions are standard and help Thailand maintain public health protocols.

### Step 8: Review and Submit

Before submitting, carefully review all information for accuracy. Once you click "Submit," you'll receive a confirmation number and a QR code via email. **Save this confirmation**—you'll need it at immigration.

---

## 4. Cost and Fees

One of the best aspects of the TDAC system is that it's completely **free**. There are no government fees, processing charges, or hidden costs associated with submitting your digital arrival card.

**Official cost**: THB 0 (Free)

However, be cautious of third-party websites claiming to offer "expedited" TDAC services for a fee. These are scams. The official government portal at https://tdac.immigration.go.th processes applications at no cost and doesn't offer paid expedited options.

### Where Costs May Arise

While the TDAC itself is free, related travel costs include:

- **International flights** to Thailand (varies by origin)
- **Accommodation** in Thailand (budget hostels from 300-500 THB/night; mid-range hotels 1,500-3,000 THB/night)
- **Travel insurance** (optional but recommended)
- **Visa fees** (if required for your nationality)

The TDAC is not a visa—it's simply an arrival notification system. Depending on your nationality and length of stay, you may still need a separate [Thailand visa](https://go2-thailand.com/visa/) or qualify for visa-free entry.

## 5. TDAC vs. Old TM.6 Form: What Changed?

For travelers who've visited Thailand before May 2025, the TDAC replaces the paper TM.6 form that was previously filled out on arrival. Here's what's different:

| Aspect | Old TM.6 Form | New TDAC |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Format** | Paper form (filled on plane or at counter) | Digital online form |
| **Timing** | Completed upon arrival | Must be completed 3 days before arrival |
| **Cost** | Free | Free |
| **Processing** | Manual review at immigration | Pre-processed digitally |
| **Confirmation** | Stamped on arrival | QR code via email |
| **Time at immigration** | 5-15 minutes | 1-3 minutes |
| **Error correction** | Difficult after submission | Can be corrected before arrival |

The digital system is significantly faster and more convenient. During our time navigating [Bangkok's](https://go2-thailand.com/city/bangkok/) immigration queues, we've seen processing times drop dramatically since TDAC implementation.

## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

Based on our experience helping travelers through this process, here are the most frequent errors and how to avoid them:

### Mistake 1: Submitting Too Late


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#F0FDF4;border-left:4px solid #22C55E;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:16px;">
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;margin-bottom:8px;">
        <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">🎒</span>
        <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#1F2937;">Book Tours & Activities</strong>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#4B5563;margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Skip the hassle — book Thailand day trips, cooking classes, and experiences in advance with instant confirmation.</p>
      <a href="https://klook.tpo.lv/7Dt6WApj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" style="display:inline-block;background:#16A34A;color:white;padding:10px 20px;border-radius:8px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:600;font-size:14px;">Browse Activities on Klook →</a>
    </div>
    <a href="https://klook.tpo.lv/7Dt6WApj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" style="flex-shrink:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;">
      <img src="/images/qrcodes/qrcode-klook.jpeg" alt="Scan to visit Book Tours & Activities" style="width:72px;height:72px;border-radius:8px;border:1px solid #22C55E33;" />
      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


**The problem**: Waiting until the day before arrival or submitting after you've already entered Thailand.

**The solution**: Submit 5-7 days before arrival. This gives the system time to process and allows room for corrections.

### Mistake 2: Name Discrepancies

**The problem**: Entering your name differently than it appears on your passport (e.g., "John Smith" vs. "John Michael Smith").

**The solution**: Copy your name exactly as it appears in your passport, including middle names and special characters.

### Mistake 3: Wrong Arrival Date

**The problem**: Entering an incorrect arrival date, then arriving on a different day.

**The solution**: If your plans change, resubmit the TDAC with the correct date. Don't arrive on a date different from what you submitted.

### Mistake 4: Invalid Email Address

**The problem**: Entering an email incorrectly and not receiving your confirmation QR code.

**The solution**: Double-check your email address before submitting. Use an email you check regularly.

### Mistake 5: Vague Accommodation Address

**The problem**: Entering "Bangkok" or "Thailand" without a specific address.

**The solution**: Provide a specific street address, hotel name, or at minimum a neighborhood and district.

**Pro Tip**: Screenshot your TDAC confirmation QR code and save it to your phone. Immigration officers can scan it directly, and having a backup prevents issues if your email is inaccessible.

<div style="background:#FEF3C7;border-left:4px solid #F59E0B;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:12px;">
    <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">💡</span>
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#92400E;display:block;margin-bottom:6px;">Pro Tip</strong>
      <p style="color:#78350F;margin:0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Save your TDAC confirmation email and QR code to your phone before traveling. Even if you have internet issues at the airport, you'll have proof of submission.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## 7. What to Do If You Lose Your TDAC Confirmation

If you don't receive your TDAC confirmation email or lose the QR code, don't panic. You have several options:

### Option 1: Check Your Email Spam Folder

Sometimes confirmation emails end up in spam or promotions folders. Search for "TDAC" or "Thailand Immigration" in your email.

### Option 2: Log Back Into the TDAC Portal

If you remember the email and password you used, you can log back into https://tdac.immigration.go.th and retrieve your confirmation number and QR code.

### Option 3: Contact Immigration Before Arrival

Email the Thailand Immigration Bureau through the official website if you're having technical issues. Provide your passport number and arrival details.

### Option 4: Arrive Early at Immigration

If all else fails, arrive early at immigration and explain the situation. Have your passport ready and be prepared to provide the details you submitted (arrival date, flight number, accommodation address). Immigration officers can look up your submission in the system.

**Budget Option**: Don't pay third-party "recovery" services claiming they can retrieve your TDAC for a fee. The immigration system is free to access.

---

## 8. TDAC and Different Visa Types

Your TDAC requirement doesn't change based on your visa type, but it's important to understand how the TDAC relates to your specific entry status:

### Visa-Free Entry

If you're eligible for visa-free entry (most Western nationalities get 30-60 days), you still must complete the TDAC. The TDAC is not a visa—it's an arrival notification system that works alongside visa-free entry.

### Tourist Visa (TM.86)

If you've obtained a Tourist Visa from a Thai embassy before arrival, you still need to complete the TDAC. The visa and TDAC are separate requirements.

### Digital Nomad Visa (DTV)

Long-term visitors on the [Digital Nomad Visa](https://go2-thailand.com/visa/digital-nomad-visa/) must also complete the TDAC upon each entry or re-entry into Thailand.

### Retirement Visa

Retirees on the [Retirement Visa](https://go2-thailand.com/visa/retirement-visa/) must complete the TDAC when initially entering Thailand and potentially on re-entries depending on their specific visa conditions.

### Education and Work Visas

Students on [Education Visas](https://go2-thailand.com/visa/education-visa/) and workers on employment visas must complete the TDAC upon initial entry.

> **Did You Know?** According to the Immigration Act B.E. 2522, all foreign nationals staying in Thailand longer than 90 days must notify the nearest Immigration Officer of their place of residence. The TDAC system helps immigration track this requirement more efficiently.

## 9. TDAC for Families and Group Travel

If you're traveling with family or a group, each person must complete their own TDAC. Here's how to handle different scenarios:

### Traveling with Children


<div data-widget-fallback style="background:#EFF6FF;border-left:4px solid #3B82F6;border-radius:12px;padding:20px 24px;margin:32px 0;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:16px;">
    <div style="flex:1;">
      <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px;margin-bottom:8px;">
        <span style="font-size:28px;line-height:1;">🚗</span>
        <strong style="font-size:18px;color:#1F2937;">Rent a Car in Thailand</strong>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#4B5563;margin:0 0 12px 0;font-size:15px;line-height:1.5;">Compare car rental prices across Thailand. Pick up at airports or city locations with flexible cancellation.</p>

      <span style="display:block;font-size:10px;color:#6B7280;margin-top:4px;">Scan me</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>


Parents or guardians must complete the TDAC on behalf of children. You'll need:

- Child's full name (as it appears in their passport)
- Child's date of birth
- Child's passport number
- Same accommodation address as the adults

Children don't need separate email confirmations—one adult can manage all family TDACs.

### Group Travel

If you're traveling with friends or colleagues, each person completes their own TDAC independently. You can all use the same accommodation address if you're staying at the same hotel.

### Infants and Babies

Even infants traveling on their own passport must have a TDAC completed. If traveling on a parent's passport (some countries allow this), the parent's TDAC covers them.

**Pro Tip**: Create a shared document or spreadsheet with all travelers' TDAC confirmation numbers before arrival. This makes it easy to reference if immigration has questions.

## 10. What Happens at Immigration After Submitting Your TDAC

Understanding what to expect at immigration helps you prepare and move through the process smoothly. Here's what typically happens:

### Before You Arrive

Once you submit your TDAC, the immigration system processes your information and creates a digital record. Immigration officers can access this data before you even land, allowing them to pre-screen arrivals and identify any potential issues.

### At the Airport or Border

When you arrive at immigration:

1. **Present your passport** to the immigration officer
2. **Show your TDAC QR code** (on your phone or printed)—the officer will scan it
3. **Answer standard questions** if asked (purpose of visit, accommodation, length of stay)
4. **Receive your passport stamp** with your permitted stay duration

The entire process typically takes 1-3 minutes per person, significantly faster than the old paper system.

### Common Questions Immigration May Ask

Even with the TDAC pre-submitted, immigration officers may ask:

- "What's the purpose of your visit?"
- "How long are you staying?"
- "Where are you staying?"
- "Do you have a return ticket?"
- "How much money are you bringing?"

These are standard questions. Answer honestly and confidently.

### If There's a Problem

If immigration finds an issue with your TDAC (wrong date, name mismatch, etc.), they'll inform you immediately. In most cases, they'll allow you to correct minor errors on the spot. Serious discrepancies might result in denial of entry, though this is rare.

**What to do**: Stay calm, explain any honest mistakes, and cooperate fully. Immigration officers are generally understanding about genuine errors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I submit my TDAC more than 3 days in advance?

Yes, you can submit your TDAC well in advance—even weeks before arrival. However, the system requires submission within 3 days before arrival at minimum. If you submit very early and your plans change, you can resubmit with updated information.

### What if my flight gets cancelled and I arrive on a different date?

If your arrival date changes, you should resubmit your TDAC with the new date. Arriving on a date significantly different from your submitted TDAC might raise questions at immigration, though officers typically understand travel disruptions.

### Is the TDAC valid for multiple entries?

No, the TDAC is valid for a single entry only. If you leave Thailand and return, you must complete a new TDAC for your re-entry.

### Do I need to print my TDAC confirmation?

No, printing is not necessary. Immigration officers can scan the QR code directly from your phone. However, having a printed backup is a good precaution if your phone battery dies.

### What if I'm transiting through Thailand without officially entering?

If you're staying in the airport and not clearing immigration, you don't need a TDAC. However, if you're leaving the airport for any reason, you must clear immigration and therefore need a TDAC.

### Can I use the TDAC for land border crossings?

Yes, the TDAC is required for all entry points including land borders (e.g., [Bangkok to Chiang Mai](https://go2-thailand.com/transport/bangkok-to-chiang-mai/) overland routes) and seaports. The process is the same regardless of how you enter Thailand.

### What if I don't have an accommodation address yet?

You can use a general address or your first hotel's address. You don't need a confirmed booking—the immigration system just needs a location reference. You can update your actual accommodation after arrival.

### Is there a TDAC app, or is it only online?

The TDAC is accessed through the website https://tdac.immigration.go.th. There's no official mobile app—use the website on your phone's browser or desktop computer.

### What languages is the TDAC available in?

The TDAC portal supports multiple languages including English, Thai, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, and others. You can select your preferred language when you start the application.

### Can travel agents or hotels submit the TDAC on my behalf?

While some travel agencies or hotels may offer to submit it for you, it's safest to submit it yourself directly through the official government portal. This ensures accuracy and gives you direct access to your confirmation details.
