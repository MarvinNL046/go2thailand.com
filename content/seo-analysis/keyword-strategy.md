# Keyword Research & Blog Content Strategy
## go2thailand.com -- Roadmap from 27 to 1,000+ Organic Keywords

**Date:** February 2026
**Current status:** 27 organic keywords ranking
**Target:** 1,000+ keywords within 12 months

---

## 1. Executive Summary

go2thailand.com has a solid data-driven foundation with ~492 base pages across 8 locales (~3,444 total URLs). However, the site currently ranks for only 27 organic keywords -- a massive underperformance relative to content volume. The primary reasons are:

1. **Missing "money" content:** No blog posts targeting high-volume informational queries that millions of Thailand travelers search for (itineraries, budgets, safety, first-timer guides).
2. **Thin topical authority:** Existing pages are data-driven reference pages (city profiles, food listings, transport routes) but lack the in-depth editorial content Google rewards.
3. **No pillar/cluster architecture:** Pages exist in isolation without strong internal linking clusters around core topics.
4. **Blog is nascent:** Only ~12 English blog posts, most published very recently (Feb 2026), with limited topical diversity.

**The strategy:** Publish 50+ targeted blog posts over 12 months, optimize existing pages for quick wins, and build topical authority clusters around 8 core themes. This should realistically grow the site from 27 to 1,000+ ranking keywords.
